This project was a personal project to learn backend coding. I used [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model my data and defined routing with [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html).


You can find a demo of this project [here](https://events-app-mern.herokuapp.com).

More info on the project can be found below.

## App Information

The app was meant to display events created by an admin. In order to become an admin a person needs to create an account and then be added by an existing admin. As of now events only have start and end dates without times. Form validation is on the front-end instead of backend or both.

## Sources

My basic schemas for events and users were modeled after an existing group project that I unfortunately cannot display. The routes for events were also modeled after that. I also looked at express and mongoose documentation to understand what exactly I was doing.

Of course most learning projects cannot be accomplished without online articles/tutorials. I can't remember all that I used and if I should have given you credit lmk.

The one I do remember was for the login system. After several hours of researching the best ways to create a login system for a MERN app, Josh's [article](https://codemoto.io/coding/nodejs/email-verification-node-express-mongodb) really saved me! Of course I modified the code to fit my needs but he was very concise in the article which helped me easily implement it withinmy app.
